Collaborators:
- Achintya Rao (UWE/Cambridge)
- Roly Perera (Cambridge/UoB)
- Tomas Petricek (Charles University)

Interns:
- Colin Crawford (Edinburgh)
- Haofei Chen (Edinburgh)
- Hana Iza Kim (Cambridge)
- Thomas Frith (Cambridge)

In parallel, Roly and Joe Bond will also be working on a new design of the core dependency-tracking approach but this is unlikely to make it into this iteration of Fluid Examples.

## Expected outputs

2 mini articles hosted on the web, each with 2-3 interactive visualisations written in Fluid. Based on existing research and chosen strategically to develop relationships/collaborations. Perhaps using something like the Distill template (distill.pub).

## Research paper

Later in the year we would also like to use the mini-articles as case studies in a research paper or position paper about transparent data visualisations. We could go for something like IEEE Viz (maybe with Benjamin Bach as a coauthor), Nature Computational Science or [Royal Society Open Science](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.240275).
